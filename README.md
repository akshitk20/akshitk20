Graduated Software Engineer
A web developer (most of the time)
Most projects are personal projects that I like to work on.
I will probably not maintain them anymore if they don't interest me, but feel free to look around! ✨
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects using spring-boot as a backend component. Also comfortable in developing microservices, REST API's and GraphQL API's.
